# fixmycity

This repository builds on my existing project "Fix My City", of which it aims to be a sort of improved "2.0" version. In particular, the following are key goals of this refactoring:

1. Improve design, styling and user interactions
2. Replace Mapbox with Google Maps API as the core library of the project
3. Replace JavaScript with TypeScript
4. Experiment with Tailwind CSS
5. Add front-end testing in Jest
6. Evaluate a framework in Go to potentially replace Django
7. Make the website a PWA
